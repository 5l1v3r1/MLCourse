As we increase the computer program's exposure to experience, its performance can either stay the same, get worse, or improve. If performance improves, we say that the computer program *learns from experience*. If not, then there's no machine learning to speak of.\n",

    "- Predict a number (e.g., something that's on a continuous scale, like temparature)\n",
    "- Predict a category or class (e.g., smoker or non-smoker?)\n",

    "    - Reduction/Compression (can the dataset be represented by one that has fewer features?)\n",
    "    \n",
    "In machine learning, prediction is possible only when the dataset has a clearly demarcated output column. In other words, we need to have a dataset that already says if the values of features f1, f2, f3 are such and such then the value of the output is such and such. If we don't have this kind of dataset, we *cannot* predict anything.\n",

Rather, in these cases, machine learning algoritms are used to better understand the structure of the dataset -- whether and how the elements of the dataset are grouped together, how these elements are associated with each other.

If the feature values are in the dataset then we can just look up the output in the dataset and we wouldn't need to predict anything. \n",
